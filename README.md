# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The reason for this projects is to analyze the Pybers ride services data and find differences in the frequency of rides based on different types of city. This can help make there ride sharing servoce more flexable to different areas and can have impacts on how they market there service in the future. 

## Results
If you take a look at the data frame below, you can see that by divide the Pyber data into sections based on the type of area the rides are being taken, it reveals that there are some major differences in how many rides are being taken, how many drivers are in those areas, and how much those driverrs are getting paid.

### Urban 
The urban areas make up 62.7% of the total Pyber rides taken making it have the largest capacity of rides and total fares at $39,854.38 . Despite this, urban areas are the most competitve for Pyber drivers. This makes urban areas the least profitable for drivers as it has the lowest fare per ride at $16.57 per ride and $24.53 payed to drivers. Urban areas have the most drivers at 2,405 which surpasses the amount of rides 1,625. 


###Rural 
Rural areas account for the lowest amount of rides and make up 6.8% of the total rides. Rural areas also have more rides taken than drivers in the area making its ride fare and driver fares the highest out of the three city types. The fares are the highest out of the three city types at $34.62 per ride and $55.49. 

### Suburban 
Suburban areas are in the middle of both urban and rural areas at %30.5 of the total fares at $19,356.33. There average fare per ride is $30.97 and average fare for drivers is $39.50 There driver to rides ratio is the most balanced at almost a 1:1 ratio. 

## Summary and Recommendations
With the Pyber data, you can see that the balance needed for a sustainable system of drivers and rides might not be upheld in its current state. Rural areas have more rides than drivers available and this makes rides in those areas more costly. Pyber could increase advertisment in these areas to hore more drivers to lower costs in the area. 
Urban areas have more drivers than rides in this area making it harder for drivers to make money, this high number of driverrs also drives down the price drivers are getting paid, on average making less than the other three types. If advertisement for rides in this area were to increase or increasing the range of available rides available to drivers were extended to nearby rural areas were present, this may balance out this discrepancy.
